# Project Name - Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai

The purpose of this project is the create an online platform for Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai to 
provide it users a way of being able to interact with the gym and find important information 
regarding class schedule, resources on offer, membership plans/prices, contact info, address etc. 
In addition, this is also for Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai to allow them to have a presence online and 
help drive more members and inquiries to join. It will do this by highlighting the excitement 
of muay thai and the health benefits it offers while traversing through an easy to navigate website. 

## UX
The UX for this project will be investigated through the following five planes:

### Strategy Plane:
Business goals? 
<br>The main goal of the business is to increase the amount of new members coming to 
the gym and help retain the existing members. 

Why are we special? 
Who are competitors? What are they doing? 
<br>
Within the Dublin area, the main competitor is SBG Ireland and Origins Muay Thai. Near my own home 
Carlow Muay Thai is the main competitor however do not have an online presence.

Tech considerations? <br>
Building for mobile demographic or scientific/formal demographic? Website will need to 
be well optimized for mobile as we suspect majority of users will be those on the go. 

Why would a user want this? <br>
Existing User would want this to check opening times, class schedules and contact information. 
New user would also want to check the aforementioned but also price and location

Who is my target audience? <br>
Target audience are customers that are looking to learn muay thai/self-defence, get fit and lose weight. 

When you go to a particular site, where do you go first? <br> 
Existing customers want to see contact info, schedule times and contact info. New users want to be 
engaged immediately but also be able to see where price and location is. Muay thai is very niche so 
a FAQ section may also proof to be beneficial

Why do you go there in particular? <br>
To check times, schedule, contact, location and prices
What makes a good experience? 
Ease of access to information needs to be paramount which means a simple site structure. To attract new 
users to join, the site needs to be catchy and engaging from the jump. 

What's worth doing?
Opportunity/Problem | Important | Feasability/Viability
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Create Online Presence | 5 | 5
Location on map | 5 | 5
Gallery highlighting gym | 5 | 5
Image hover feature | 2 | 3
Price  | 5 | 5
Schedule & Opening hours | 5 | 5
FAQ | 4 | 5
Testimonials of existing users | 4 | 5
Iframe video on homepage to help engagement for new users | 3 | 3
Streetview type tour to allow potential users to navigate through gym | 1 | 1
Advertising and selling of gym merchandise | 1 | 1
		

Will it add value, and what value will it add?
Who's our target audience? Who is our demographic, or our demographics?  <br>
Our target audience are current gym members and potential gym members who are looking to get fit, 
learn muay thai/self defense and lose weight 

What experiences are compelling to them? <br>
Seeing existing members having fun and working hard to achieve their fitness goals. 

How is our offering, or proposed offering, different from our competitors and substitutes? <br>
As it stands, no competitors are highlighting schedules or prices from the get go, which will be what 
new users are wanting to know. In addition, no competitors are offering any sort of notable engagement 
to attract new customers. Therefore, when a user comes on to site I want them to be engaged immediately, 
see all vital information and be able to see why doing muay thai is beneficial for them. 

<br>

### Scope Plane:
Whats on the table? <br>
Most important features at this stage in no particular order are as follows: <br>
* Contact info,
* About,
* Location,
* Schedule,
* Pricing,
* Opening hours,
* FAQ,
* Gallery,
* Testimonials/Reviews.

Iframing an engaging video to homepage of site is deemed important however due to current knowledge 
may be difficult to pull off. We will see how we progress. 

Want to offer a hover over feature on gallery images so that when a user puts cursor over image, the image will 
expand taking up full page. Not hugely important so will wait and see how we progress.

Streetview tour while it may look impressive is not something that is currently important or feasible 
however may be the next step in project evolution and user engagement. 

In addition, gym has merchandise (shorts, gloves jerseys) that it wants to advertise and sell online. 
Again, not deemed important or feasible at present but may be an additional feature at a later dates

User story/s:

- As new member I want to make an informed decision if this gym is the right choice.
 
- As a new user I want to know where the gym is.

- As a new user I want to know what time the classes are on.

- As a new user I want to know what the contact information is for any follow up questions. 

- Secondly (but just as important) the user wants to know if joining the gym is going to be worth doing, 
therefore the site needs to be engaging immediately highlighting the fun, toughness and dedication it takes 
to train muay thai. Also highlighting what Muay thai is.  


- As an existing member I want to know what the schedule times are.

- As an existing member I want to know what the opening hours are.

- As an existing member I am on the go and have a million and one different commitments. Therefore when I 
come to site it will most likely be on mobile.

### The Structure Plane:
Information architecture: <br>
Based off the info in Strategy and Scope, a tree structure list seems to be the most appropriate structure the model 
this project on. 

Home > Gallery > Contact

Principles of Organization: <br>
- Currently stands that users to be engaged as soon as they come to site is main priority. Implementation of 5 
second rule. 
- Also want to show entire site map as soon as user comes on through nav bar and anchor drop links on homepage. 
- Why do muay thai will serve as the about us and will show above the fold. 
- Schedule/Pricing is a commonly used segment so will be placed in middle of homepage.

decision to join.

brought back to homepage. On Homepage and Anchor drop nav bar will be added to allow users quick and easy 
navigation through homepage.

easily with gym.
